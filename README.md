Welcome to the official repository of **SFENet**, our novel deep learning framework engineered for high-precision crop health monitoring. We tackle the critical challenge of identifying nutrient deficiencies in plant leaves with a cutting-edge approach that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency domain analysis through an ensemble of meticulously enhanced deep neural networks.

## ‚ú® Overview: Bridging Spatial and Spectral Insights for Agricultural Intelligence

Our work introduces **SFENet**, a powerful architecture that goes beyond traditional RGB-based analysis by deeply integrating **spatial-frequency domain features**. At its core, SFENet leverages an ensemble of three state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks‚Äî**DenseNet121**, **ResNeXt50**, and **Inception V3**‚Äîeach augmented with our custom-designed **Spectral Guided Convolution (SGC)** and **Hierarchical Frequency Selector (HFS)** modules. This innovative combination allows the network to capture both intricate spatial details and crucial spectral characteristics inherent in leaf imagery, leading to superior nutrient deficiency detection in banana and coffee crops.
